Moreover, my knowledge about the product development process allows me to see the whole picture since the beginning, which is very helpful to build the whole production code from scratch; this has given me the opportunity on different projects of intercommunicating with several members of a team by prioritizing tasks in order to achieve a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).</p>
